The project report titled "Online Quiz Application" details the development of an Android-based quiz application by Hemanth Kumar S, L P Sanjay, and Rakesh P, students from the Channabasaveshwara Institute of Technology. The application, developed using Java in Android Studio, is designed to offer quizzes on various topics for both educational and entertainment purposes. Unlike traditional paper-based exams, this application provides an efficient, cost-effective, and user-friendly alternative by enabling quizzes to be taken and graded electronically. This shift not only saves time and resources but also offers immediate feedback and allows multiple quiz attempts to enhance learning.

The "Online Quiz Application" project utilizes several technical components and methodologies to achieve its objectives. Developed in Android Studio using Java, the application targets a wide range of Android devices by supporting the minimum SDK version JellyBean, ensuring compatibility with approximately 99.8% of all Android devices. The project implements a unified approach to application development, leveraging Android's open-source nature. Key technical elements include the use of SQLite for lightweight relational database management, ensuring efficient data storage and retrieval. The design encompasses both logical and physical aspects, with logical design addressing data flow, output specifications, and security measures, while physical design involves creating detailed specifications for input/output media, database design, and system implementation plans. The user interface is crafted using XML for layout management, ensuring a cohesive and user-friendly experience. Additionally, the application employs a single orientation mode (portrait) for better usability and incorporates features like immediate feedback and randomized question order to enhance the quiz-taking experience.
